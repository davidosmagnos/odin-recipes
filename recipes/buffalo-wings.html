    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound chicken wings, split and tips discarder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup red hot sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar (optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of<br> the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add chicken wings, put lid on steamer, and steam <br>wings until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes. An<br> instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread chicken wings onto a platter to cool; pat dry with paper towel. <br>Spread wings onto a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake wings in preheated oven for 20 minutes, flip, <br>and continue to bake until crispy, about 20 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over low heat. Stir hot sauce, brown sugar, onion powder, <br>garlic powder, and cayenne pepper into the melted butter; cook, stirring occasionally, until the seasonings dissolve into<br> the liquid and the mixture is hot, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Put wings in a large bowl; pour sauce over wings and toss to coat.</li>
    </ol>
